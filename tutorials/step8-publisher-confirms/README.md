# Tutorial for Publisher Confirms

This is to perform Publisher confirms. The confirmation is from the broker, not from the consumer.

1. Make sure that the RabbigMQ server is up and running. See [step 1 tutorial](../step1-install-server/README.md).
2. Install the target .NET SDK or Runtime from [Download .NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0). After installation, run "dotnet --info" to verify.
3. Follow [Publisher Confirms](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-seven-dotnet.html).
